# Movie Recommendation System 📽️

As a part of my project at **Bharat Intern Machine Learning internship**, I developed a Recommendation System with **Collaborative Filtering** to find the similar users, and recommend movies based on it.

To execute the streamlit based movie recommender app, execute the following piece of code after cloning the repository

```python
python -m streamlit run movie_recommender.py
```
